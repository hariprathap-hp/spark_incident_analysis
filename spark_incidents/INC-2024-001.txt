Incident ID: INC-2024-001
Date: 2024-02-12
Cluster: Spark-Prod-Cluster-A
Application: Daily Aggregation Job
Error Summary: ExecutorLostFailure: Executor exited due to memory pressure
Root Cause: Highly skewed data in user_events table; a single user_id consumed most of the partition memory.
Resolution:
  - Applied salting on user_id to distribute records evenly.
  - Increased executor memory overhead from 1g to 2g.
  - Validated partition sizes post-salting using Spark UI.
Key Learnings: Monitor shuffle metrics and partition sizes to detect skew early.
