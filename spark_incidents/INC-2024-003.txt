Incident ID: INC-2024-003
Date: 2024-03-14
Cluster: Spark-Batch-Cluster-C
Application: Customer Churn Model Training
Error Summary: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
Root Cause: Driver collected entire RDD into memory for model fitting step.
Resolution:
  - Replaced .collect() with .mapPartitions() for incremental processing.
  - Used DataFrame API with aggregations instead of RDD reduce.
  - Increased driver memory to 8g temporarily.
Key Learnings: Avoid collect() operations on large RDDs; leverage DataFrame transformations.
